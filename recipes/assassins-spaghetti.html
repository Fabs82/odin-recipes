    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Caramelized tomato sauce makes this a <strong>wonderfully savory dish</strong>. The reduction of the tomato broth
        brings out the sweetness of the tomatoes which balances well with the spiciness of the chili flakes.

    <h3>Trivia</h3>
    <p>The debut of <i>spaghetti all'assassina</i> on restaurant menus most probably took place in the late 1960s and
        early 1970s. Many trace the original dish back to the Marc'Aurelio restaurant in the city centre of Bari (which
        is now closed); others suggest the Al Sorso Preferito restaurant, where the dish is still served today.
        According to Felice Giovine, a historian of Apulian cuisine, <i>spaghetti all'assassina</i> originates from Al
        Sorso Preferito, a restaurant in the city centre of Bari, where it was created in 1967 by Foggian chef Enzo
        Francavilla at the request of two customers from Northern Italy. Due to its spiciness, they jokingly called
        Francavilla <i>assassino </i>('murderer'), a word from which the name of the dish later derived. This is also
        the version of events favoured by the Accademia dell'Assassina, a group of culinary experts and enthusiasts
        founded in Bari in 2013 to protect against the diffusion of the recipe.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><em>Original recipe yields 4 servings</em></p>
    <h3>Tomato Broth</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 cups tomato puree</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assassin's Spaghetti</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons red chili flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>6 ounces dry spaghett</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic and sizzle until it starts to turn golden and fragrant,
            about 1 minute. Stir in tomato puree, water, and salt. Bring to a simmer on medium-high. Once simmering,
            reduce to low heat and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour olive oil into a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, season with chili flakes and heat until
            chili flakes start to sizzle, for 1 minute. Add raw spaghetti and toss until well coated with chili oil.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in about 3 cups of tomato broth and, using tongs, move pasta from side to side to evenly distribute
            tomato broth. Cook, occasionally moving pasta from side to side with tongs, all facing the same direction,
            until most of the broth has been absorbed or evaporated, and the spaghetti starts frying in the pan.</li>
        <li>Turn spaghetti over with tongs, and evenly arrange in the pan. Keep cooking until the pasta starts to brown,
            and even lightly chars.</li>
        <li>Add about 2 more cups of tomato broth, and repeat the process. Continue cooking until the spaghetti is as
            charred as you like , and cooked to your desired doneness. More broth can be added at the end of the process
            for a saucier version, as shown in the video, or it can be served relatively dry.</li>
        <li>Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and more chili flakes if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!!!</li>
    </ol>
